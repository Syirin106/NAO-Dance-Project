# Nao Robot Choregraphe Dance Project

This project contains 2 dance routines created using Choregraphe for the NAO robot. Each dance routine is saved in the ‘.pml ‘ format, which can be loaded into Choregraphe software to program the robot to perform a series of movements. 

# Files

-	First file: solo_jennie_take1
-	Contains ‘solo_jennie_take1.pml ‘ which has the dance sequence of Solo song by Jennie of Blackpink

-	Second file: task2_take1
-	Contains ‘task2_take1.pml’  which has the dance sequence of 1 remix song of Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae) by Silentó, Super Shy by NewJeans, A Thousand Years by Christina Perri, and Gangnam Style by PSY.

-	Use Choregraphe to open these files and deploy the dance to your NAO robot.

# The objectives of this project

-	First file focuses on the intermediate dance routines, involving synchronized body movements and song timing.
